The Request Response Cycle: 

1. Client make a request such as "http://www.amazon.com"
2. Client get back a response from the server (the computer that amazon owns that has all their web pages). The response is a web page.
3. The response consists of: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


HTML- The content of the web page (Text, images, form inputs, form dropdowns, checkboxes/radio buttons, buttons, links)

CSS- The styling of the content and arranging the content (Make the background color blue, change font color and font style. Place some content next to another content)

JS- The manipulation of the content and styling based on user events (clicking, scrolling, hovering the mouse). For example, if I click on something, more content appears. Based on the user interaction, it changes the appearance of the page.
